# my dotfiles

Graciously derived from [mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/) and [paulirish](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles/), with a little bit of love and care on my part.

## install

This is mostly to remind myself.

```bash
➜ cd ~/code
➜ git clone git@github.com:repeatingbeats/dotfiles
# warning! destructive
➜ git submodule update --init
➜ ./bootstrap.sh
```
